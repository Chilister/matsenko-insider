## How It Works

In the first step we calculate percent for
WON mark as Wp (Won Percent)
Drawn mark as Dp (Drawn Percent)
Lost mark as Lp (Lost Percent)

### percent = plays / (won or drawn od lost)

<p>in the next step we calculate average goal difference AVG(GD)</p>
<p>if GD > AVG(GD) + 25% then add to Wp + 5%</p>
<p>if GD < AVG(GD) - 25% then add to Lp + 5%</p>
<p>else add to Dp + 5%</p>
